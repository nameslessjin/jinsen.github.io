# Personal Website Template
This template is adapted from Jon Barron's public academic website: https://jonbarron.info/ and Leonid Keselman's public academic website: https://leonidk.com/.
You can check the original repos at [Jon Barron's repo](https://github.com/jonbarron/website) and [Leonid Keselman's repo](https://github.com/leonidk/leonidk.github.io). 
I have converted the website for my own use.  On the top of the original design, I have created data-drive method to generate content and added adaption for mobile device!  Feel free to use this code as a template for your own personal use.  Please respect copyright for all content in `images` folders.

## Template
* If you want to change the bio, you can simply modify the begining of index.html.
* If you are only interested in adding more experience and projects, please check out [Content.js](https://github.com/nameslessjin/nameslessjin.github.io/blob/master/Content.js).  I have created a data-driven way to create more entries by simply adding properties like title and description.  No coding required.
* If you are interested in creating new sections while following the same template, check out the end of [Components.js](https://github.com/nameslessjin/nameslessjin.github.io/blob/master/Components.js) to see how each section is generated.
